# Concept of algorithm and flowchart


## Algorithm

An algorithm is a clear list of steps you follow to solve a problem or do a task.

### Example: Making a Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich
1. **Get ingredients:** bread, peanut butter, jelly, knife, plate.
2. **Spread peanut butter** on one slice of bread.
3. **Spread jelly** on the other slice.
4. **Put slices together** with spreads facing each other.
5. **Cut the sandwich** in half (optional).
6. **Serve** on the plate.

That list of steps is an algorithm.

### How algorithms relate to programming
- In programming, you write algorithms using code so a computer can follow the steps.
- Each step must be clear and in the right order.
- Computers need exact instructions — no guessing.

### Simple programming algorithm example (make a sandwich) in pseudo code
```
START
Take 2 slices of bread
Open peanut butter jar
Spread peanut butter on slice1
Open jelly jar
Spread jelly on slice2
Put slice1 and slice2 together
Cut sandwich if wanted
Serve sandwich
END
```

### Tips for making good algorithms
- Break big tasks into small steps.
- Be specific (exact actions, not vague).
- Test by following the steps yourself to see if they work.
- Fix any unclear or missing steps.

That's it — an algorithm is just a clear recipe for solving a problem, written so a person or computer can follow it.


## Flowchart

A flowchart is a picture that shows the steps of an algorithm using boxes and arrows. Each shape has a meaning, and the arrows show the order to follow.

### Common shapes and meanings
- **Oval:** Start or End  
- **Rectangle:** A step or action (do something)  
- **Diamond:** A decision (yes/no or true/false)  
- **Parallelogram:** Input or output (get info or show result)  
- **Arrow:** Shows the flow from one step to the next

### Simple tips for drawing flowcharts
- Put Start at the top and End at the bottom.  
- Use arrows to show direction.  
- Keep steps short and simple.  
- Use diamonds only for decisions and draw one arrow out for each possible answer.  
- Test the flowchart by following the arrows to make sure it works.

### Quick example (text layout)
Start → Get ingredients → Is bread available? → [Yes] Spread peanut butter → Spread jelly → Put slices together → Cut sandwich? → [Yes] Cut → Serve → End

That’s a flowchart: a visual recipe that helps people or computers follow steps and decisions.
