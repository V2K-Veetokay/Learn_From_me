# Concept and role of structured programming


## What is Structured Programming?

Structured programming is a way to write code so it's easy to read, understand, and fix — like writing clear instructions for someone to follow.

### Imagine a Recipe
- **Recipe steps are small and clear.** You don’t mix lots of things at once.
- **Each step does one job.** “Chop onions” is separate from “cook onions.”
- **You follow the steps in order, or repeat them if needed.** No jumping randomly around the cookbook.

Structured programming makes code like that recipe.


## The Big Ideas

1. **Do one thing at a time**
   - Break a big task into small steps (called functions or procedures).
   - Example: For a game, have one function to move the player, another to draw the screen.

2. **Use only a few ways to control flow**
   - Sequence: do things in order.
   - Decision (if/else): choose between two or more paths.
   - Loop (repeat): do the same thing many times.
   - These make the program predictable — no weird jumps.

3. **No messy jumps (avoid "goto")**
   - "Goto" is like telling someone to jump to page 57 in the middle of a recipe — confusing.
   - Structured programming avoids that so the code stays clear.

4. **Name things clearly**
   - Use good names for functions and variables so others (and future you) know what they do.
   - Example: use score instead of x, or calculateTotal instead of doIt.


## Why It Matters (Role / Benefits)

- **Easier to read:** Other people can understand your code fast.
- **Easier to fix:** When there’s a bug, you can find and fix it without breaking other parts.
- **Easier to reuse:** Small functions can be used in different programs.
- **Helps teamwork:** Multiple people can work on different parts without messing up each other’s work.
- **Less bugs:** Clear structure reduces mistakes.


## Real-Life Example (Make a sandwich)
```
START
Take 2 slices of bread
Open peanut butter jar
Spread peanut butter on slice1
Open jelly jar
Spread jelly on slice2
Put slice1 and slice2 together
Cut sandwich if wanted
Serve sandwich
END
```


## Short Checklist When You Code
- Break the task into small functions.
- Use ifs and loops, not jumps.
- Give clear names.
- Keep functions short (do one job).
- Test each part before combining.

That’s structured programming — writing clear, step-by-step code so it’s like a good recipe anyone can follow.
